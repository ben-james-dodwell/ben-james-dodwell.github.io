Then, using DevOps methodologies and technologies, deploy the resume to a cloud service provider.</p>\n<p>There are several aspects of the challenge that appeal to me.</p>\n<p>Firstly, while I wouldn't consider myself to be a talented web designer due to shortage of artistic ability, I feel that I've attained a basic competence from some of my personal projects over the past few years. I like the control over layout and styling that HTML and CSS provides. Being able to use responsive web design techniques seems beneficial, for example, providing a better user experience for anyone that views the resume on a mobile device. Also, having this kind of document under source control seems like it could be useful to at least view change history.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I would love to learn more about cloud engineering and DevOps. I have some exposure from my previous and current employment, but more can only help. The Cloud Resume Challenge provides a few variants, covering different cloud service providers or advanced technologies; I currently have more experience with Microsoft Azure but would like to spend more time with AWS so I will follow <a href=\"https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/\">The Cloud Resume Challenge - AWS</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the obvious benefit to this challenge is the outcome. Having a resume available online which is easy to share and easy to maintain should help with career opportunities. The learning and experience from the project can hopefully be used throughout my career, and it also makes a great talking point and provides examples to be used in future interviews.</p>\n<p>So, let's begin.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cloud Resume Challenge: Introduction","date":"March 06, 2024","description":"Introducing The Cloud Resume Challenge."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/gatsby-blog-for-github-pages/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gatsby Blog for GitHub Pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/cloud-resume-challenge/02-static-website/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cloud Resume Challenge: Static Website"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9aa35337-a789-58ce-9adb-3cac9b5428f8","previousPostId":"e0e4ca11-73e5-5335-962a-2810046c098b","nextPostId":"574cc0d5-59bc-5afe-920c-6f764faf64c0"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721","545821525"],"slicesMap":{}}
