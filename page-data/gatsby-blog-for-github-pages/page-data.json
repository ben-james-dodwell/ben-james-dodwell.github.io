I will cover that project in the next post, but wanted to begin with some information about the setup of the blog itself.</p>\n<p>I've opted to use <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> for hosting, primarily because it's simple and free. An added benefit is that it, of course, uses a GitHub repository for source control and GitHub Actions for a continuous deployment pipeline.</p>\n<p>For the content itself, I've utilised <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a> and specifically the <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">gatsby-starter-blog</a> template. I have some familiarity with Gatsby from a project last year, where I used it to create a quiz that I hosted with interactive media components. The framework provides some good quality of life features such as templating, and markdown to HTML conversion, without being overly complicated for my needs.</p>\n<p>There is also a <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/\">gh-pages</a> package which I have installed that allows me to create a deploy script that makes it easier to build and push the Gatsby site to GitHub Pages. I am using <a href=\"https://github.com/ben-james-dodwell/github-pages-blog\">github-pages-blog</a> repository for the source code of the Gatsby site, separate to my <a href=\"https://github.com/ben-james-dodwell/ben-james-dodwell.github.io\">GitHub Pages</a> repository for the built static pages.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gatsby Blog for GitHub Pages","date":"March 05, 2024","description":"First blog post explaining setup."}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/cloud-resume-challenge/01-introduction/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cloud Resume Challenge: Introduction"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e0e4ca11-73e5-5335-962a-2810046c098b","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"9aa35337-a789-58ce-9adb-3cac9b5428f8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721","545821525"],"slicesMap":{}}
